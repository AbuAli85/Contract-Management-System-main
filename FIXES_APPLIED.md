# Fixes Applied

## 1. Fixed Multiple Supabase Client Instances Warning

### Problem

The warning "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context" was occurring because multiple files were creating separate Supabase client instances.

### Solution

Created a singleton pattern for the Supabase browser client:

- Created `/lib/supabase/singleton.ts` that ensures only one client instance exists
- Updated all client-side files to use the singleton:
  - `/components/supabase-provider.tsx`
  - `/lib/supabase/client.ts`
  - `/lib/supabase.ts`
  - `/lib/supabaseClient.ts`

## 2. Fixed Missing File Imports

### Problem

After cleanup, some files were trying to import deleted components:

- `generate-contract-form.tsx` was deleted but still being imported
- `draft-contracts-manager.tsx` was deleted but still being imported

### Solution

Updated imports in affected files:

- `/app/[locale]/dashboard/generate-contract/page.tsx` - Changed to use `ContractGeneratorForm` instead

## 3. Cleaned Up Duplicate Files

### Files Removed (40+ files)

- Authentication duplicates (login pages, auth forms)
- Contract generator duplicates (5 different versions)
- Non-localized pages (admin, dashboard, profile)
- Unused components (forgot password, reset password, verify email)
- Test files in components directory

### Result

- Single source of truth for each component
- All pages now under `/app/[locale]/` for consistency
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## 4. Project Structure Improvements

### Current Clean Structure

```
/app/[locale]/
  ├── login/          # Single login page
  ├── dashboard/      # Dashboard pages
  ├── admin/          # Admin pages
  ├── contracts/      # Contract pages
  ├── generate-contract/  # Contract generation
  └── profile/        # User profile

/components/
  ├── auth-form.tsx   # Single auth form
  ├── contract-generator-form.tsx  # Main contract form
  └── StatusBadge.tsx # Single status badge
```

## 5. Performance Improvements

- Reduced bundle size by removing duplicate components
- Single Supabase client instance reduces memory usage
- Cleaner imports improve build times

## Next Steps

1. **Test Authentication**: Create a test user and verify login works
2. **Test Contract Generation**: Ensure the contract form works properly
3. **Monitor Console**: Check that the multiple client warning is gone
4. **Update Any Broken Links**: Some navigation links might need updating to use [locale] routes
